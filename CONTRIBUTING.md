# Contributing

Contributions should improve source quality, skill reliability, eval coverage, or Arab-world operating context.

Arab Agent Skills starts with regional API skills, but the scope is broader: marketing, sales, support, localization, content, operations, Arabic-language workflows, and the market context agents need to work with Arab taste.

All external submissions require maintainer approval before publication. A suggested skill, vendor, or workflow can stay in `needs-review` until sources, safety rules, eval prompts, and public usefulness are verified.

## Vendor Contributions

1. Prefer official docs, developer portals, OpenAPI specs, Postman collections, SDK repos, `llms.txt`, and government references.
2. Use blogs or directories only as leads.
3. Do not add claims about endpoints, payment methods, countries, pricing, compliance, SDKs, webhooks, or sandbox behavior unless they are source-backed.
4. Mark uncertain fields as `Unknown from public docs` or `Needs vendor access`.
5. Open an issue or pull request with the proposed facts and source URLs, then wait for maintainer review.

Submissions are not published automatically.

## Skill Contributions

Keep `SKILL.md` short. Put facts in `vendors/`, reusable implementation patterns in `references/`, deterministic work in `scripts/`, and launch checks in `evals/`.

Update eval prompts whenever skill routing, safety rules, or workflows change.
